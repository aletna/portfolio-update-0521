            Hi, thanks for stopping by! I'm Dennis, a music producer and
            computer scientist. In May 2021, I will graduate from SF-based
            Minerva Schools at KGI with a Bachelor of Science, double majoring
            in Computer Science & Business.

            While I do have a passion for working with large amounts of data, I
            spend just as much of my time thinking about creating. A growing
            curiosity for the product side led me down the path of teaching
            myself both Music Production and Web Development over the past
            decade. I am fascinated by the idea of building something that
            others are then able to use and enjoy, making their lives easier
            along the way. Building my latest project{" "}
            {/* <Link href="https://www.synthfeed.com"> */}
            <a className="link" target="_blank">
              SynthFeed
            </a>
            {/* </Link> */}, a service where experienced music producers can
            provide feedback to upcoming producers for a fee, nicely tied
            together my passions. I was the solo engineer on the project and
            also worked on outreach and strategy alongside my co-founder, who
            designed the platform.

            As of now I have lived, worked and studied in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, South
            Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´, Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½,
            Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· and the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, which allowed me to adapt to
            a diverse set of environments. Through my constant exposure to change, I have learned not to shy
            away from learning new skillsets whenever needed, and after having
            explored a few different industries, it has become increasingly
            important to me to find a team or company that aligns with my
            mission.
