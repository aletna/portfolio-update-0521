    "In early 2018, our team of 4 (Rebecca, Sanny, Kevin and I) participated in the DoraHacks Blockchain & AI Hackathon in San Francisco and won. We developed Odera, a peer-to-peer microfinancing platform that links lenders to borrowers who have small business proposals using both a dollar-pegged and market-driven token. As part of our solution we presented an mvp, came up with the dual coin alternative to many (at the time) single coin systems (based off of ideas seen on steemit) and a White Paper draft. The winning prize pool included ETH, which has aged very well since ;). This project also allowed us to meet with the CTO and the head of Blockchain Projects at Kiva.org to discuss the future of banking the underbanked.",
