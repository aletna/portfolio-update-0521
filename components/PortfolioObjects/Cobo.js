    'In April of 2018, a team of four (Bani, Sanny, Luis and I) were selected by our University to represent the school at the largest hackathon in the world - Jalisco Talent Land Digital - in Guadalajara, Mexico. We received a scholarship to attend the event and reached the finals. We developed a prototype and drafted a white paper as part of the overnight challenge. This excerpt of the White Paper best describes our product idea: "Cobo is a peer-to-peer ERC20 token that leverages blockchain technology to link garbage and waste buyers and sellers. We helped create a platform that enables individuals to autonomously become part of the network and we even created an application that allows people without blockchain knowledge to participate in the ecosystem. We are the first cryptocurrency system that exploits the dynamics of crypto economics to incentivize people to willingly clean the environment and generate income from these practises. The Cobo philosophy is simple: one man’s trash is another man’s treasure."',
