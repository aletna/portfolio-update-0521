    "After hearing about the concept of Non Fungible Tokens during the early CryptoPunks and CryptoKitties days, I could not stop thinking about the all the possible use cases of this new proof of digital ownership. As a way to learn Solidity and further share the technology with others, I decided to embark on the journey to build my own ERC-721 smart contract and, alongside my friend Bani, create a Card Collectible auction house based on the 2018 Soccer World Cup. I was in charge of developing and deploying the Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain and then connect it to our frontend using web3.js. We also received a Grant from the 1517 Fund to get the project off the ground.",
